# Reddit Meme Counter v0.1

This script pulls 100 comments from /r/all periodically and searches them for keywords to determine whether or not there is a meme within the comment.

- As of 0.1 this script saves meme's and their counters to a local file. 
- Planned additions include hosting them on a database and creating a web viewer.
